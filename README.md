A talk I did at London JS: Create the Web on JavaScript Front-End Optimisation.

Made with Reveal.js.

Slides were not designed to be read on their own, as you miss some of the stuff I actually say. Soon I'll turn the slides into a proper blog post with more context which should make more sense. Until then, read if you fancy and any Qs please get in touch. When the blog post is written, I'll link to it.
